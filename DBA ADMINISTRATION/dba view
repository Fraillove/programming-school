 Oracle has several views for showing lock status, some of which show the username:

    DBA_BLOCKERS - Shows non-waiting sessions holding locks being waited-on
    DBA_DDL_LOCKS - Shows all DDL locks held or being requested
    DBA_DML_LOCKS - Shows all DML locks held or being requested
    DBA_LOCK_INTERNAL - Displays 1 row for every lock or latch held or being requested with the username of who is holding the lock
    DBA_LOCKS - Shows all locks or latches held or being requested
    DBA_WAITERS - Shows all sessions waiting on, but not holding waited for locks

The DBA_LOCK_INTERNAL view is best to show locks for a specific user, and you can specify the query in the form:
SELECT
NVL(b.username,'SYS') username,
session_id,lock_type,mode_held,
mode_requested,lock_id1,lock_id2
FROM
sys.dba_lock_internal a,
sys.v_$session b
